# buddy-benchmark
In order to produce benchmarking results, copy and paste the `benchmarks` folder in `examples/conv-opt/` directory. Also add `add_subdirectory(Benchmarks)` in `examples/conv-opt/CMakeLists.txt`.

Note : The convolution implementation in buddy mlir is not feature complete at the moment and it may produce output which differs to some extent from the frameworks used in comparison.
